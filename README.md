# About me
Hi! I'm n0ct1s, a Junior Site Reliability Engineer, geek and tech enthusiast from Cartagena (Southeast Spain). Also I play the oboe as my main discipline in the Professional Music School of my city. I enjoy going for a walk to rest and disconnect as sometimes my mind needs to shut down like my production services.
